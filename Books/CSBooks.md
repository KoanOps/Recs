# Programming
If you are aiming for data roles, have **no prior programming exposure**, & **no support**, start with **Python** - closest to English.

## Python Intro
- Sweigart - *Automate the Boring Stuff with Python: Practical Programming for Total Beginners*
---
## Syntax
- [EBNF (Extended Backus–Naur Form)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus–Naur_form)

## C Programming
- Kernighan – *The C Programming Language*, 2nd ed

## Practice Paths
- Convert your large project (in say Python/Java) you already know into C *(easiest path, UNIX preferred, C lib is small)*
- Read a lot of C code, modify, observe effect, repeat *(easier path if you have good memory)*
- Take a Microprocessor Applications course to understand Assembly, and its connection to C *(harder path)*
- Write a ton of C code from scratch *(hardest path)*
